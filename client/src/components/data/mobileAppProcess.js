      "At this stage, your app idea starts taking shape and turns into an actual project. Analysis and planning begin with defining use cases and capturing detailed functional requirements. After we have identified the requirements for your app, prepare  a product roadmap. This includes prioritizing mobile app requirements and grouping them into delivery milestones. Part of the planning phase of developing an app includes identifying the skills needed for your app development initiative. For example, iOS and Andriod mobile platforms use different development technology stacks. If your goal is to build a mobile app both iOS and Andriod mobile platforms, then our mobile development team would include iOS and Andriod developers. If the scope of the of your mobile app is less complex and does'nt require platform specific controls, so we can consider creating mobile app  using cross-platform stacks such as React Native and Flutter.",

This stage will define the technical performance of your application. In deciding which technology to utilize, one important factor for your consideration is the type of application you are after: native or cross-platform. Native mobile application are written in the platform's programming langauage and frameworks and run directly on the operating system of the device such as iOS and Andriod. Native mobile apps provide best performance abd user experience. Cross-platform application can be witten in a range of programming langauge and framworks, and then complied into a native application that runs on the device operating system. Cross-platform mobile apps are good fit for simple mobile applications that dont require native device features. A typical mobile app project is made up of three integral parts backend/server-side technology, API's and Mobile frontend",
